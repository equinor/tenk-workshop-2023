# TENK Workshop

A 1.5 hour workshop on creating interfaces with HTML, CSS and Javascript for the [TENK Codecamp](https://tenknorge.com/tenk-tech-camp) for girls age 13–18 at the Bergen Public Library August 10 and 11 2023.

The workshop is based on using [Glitch](https://glitch.com/), a free online platform for creating web apps.

The main concept is that the attendees will get a glimpse into what it’s like working as a frontend developer, there’s not enough time to learn everything from scratch in just 1.5 hours. So there will be an app that’s half made with design tokens as custom properties based on open props. We will record a video of a fictional colleague who was supposed to make a mockup of a design, but who got fed up with the bad weather and went on holiday. Before she left she added TODO comments in the code on what has to be finished. That way the girls who are curious and pro-active will find new tasks when exploring the code, while the main topics will be discussed and demonstrated for everyone.

The design will be based on one of the Amplify designs but built with a simplified set of EDS 2.0 tokens. 

## Some things to consider:
- Will there be a storybook?
- Should we just use vanilla html?

## Topics:
- Class toggling for menu collapsing
  - Extra assignment can be to add an animation

## Documentation:
- We will start by using view source in the browser, so the documentation should be comments in the code, to encourage exploration

## Conclusion
- End the workshop with showing how the template we’ve used can be re-used into making their own personal website
